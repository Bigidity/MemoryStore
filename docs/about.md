## About This Project

Welcome to the official documentation for this project. This resource aims to provide comprehensive information about the features, installation process, and usage guidelines.

## Why This Project Exists

I always struggled with understanding the `MemoryStoreService` API, as I found Roblox’s documentation to be somewhat difficult to grasp. That’s why I created this module—to provide a simpler, more intuitive way to work with `MemoryStoreService`. Not only did I spend countless hours setting up basic logic every time I needed to use it, but I also found the process unnecessarily complex. This module eliminates that hassle by handling most of the work for you, making the API more accessible and easier to understand
