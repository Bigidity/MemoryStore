# MemoryStore

MemoryStore allows you to interact with the MemoryStoreService class more easily than before.

## Why MemoryStore?

MemoryStore is built with ease in mind. Since MemoryStoreService logic can be quite repetitive and hard to understand for new developers, I have created an easier way to interact and understand, with useful utility functions that handle all the hard parts for you. Additionally, MemoryStore is highly customizable and can fit right into your existing project!
